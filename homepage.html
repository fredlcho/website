          <div class = "about_me_desc">I was never the most academic,
            or even dedicated student. I would do homework, casually study,
            and call it a day. However, through time, I've come to realize that
            if one was to be successful, this mindset could never grant that success.
            A passion needed to be developed. That is why I now dedicate
            every day to learning, no matter how big or small. In today's day and age,
            there is nothing short of that you can't find on the internet. I write
            this to you, the reader, as well as to myself in the future, as a reminder
            that knowledge is power, and the only thing stopping you is yourself. </div>
